1) Problem
Problem Statement :

Joe was reading an interesting novel when all of a sudden, his 5 year old son came to him and started asking few questions about functions.

He tried making him understand various functions, but his son didnâ€™t get find it interesting.

Then he created his function Absent number function A(S)

According to this function, there is always the smallest positive integer number in a sequence that is not available.

In simple words,if you sort the given sequence ,then the smallest integer number (other than 0) which is not present in the sequence is the Absent number.

Consider a sequence S= [1, 2, 3], then B(S)=4

The minimum value greater than 0 which is not present here is in the sequence is 4.

Now his son found it interesting ,so Joe extended this logic to sub-sequence.

If there is a given sequence S, you have to find the Absent Number for each sub-sequence and then sum it up.

if the answer is large, print the result modulo, 109 +7.

Let say there exist a sequence with N = 3, and sequence S = [1, 2, 1]

Below are the various sub-sequences of it,

Basically it will be 2N:

[ ] : B([ ]) = 1

[1] : B([1]) = 2

[2] : B([2]) = 1

[1] : B([1]) = 2

[1, 2] : B([1, 2]) = 3

[2, 1] : B([2, 1]) = 3

[1, 1] : B([1, 1]) = 2

[1, 2, 1] : B([1, 2, 1]) = 3

Total sum of all B(S) = 1+2+1+2+3+3+2+3 = 17.

Hence the answer is 17.

2) PROBLEM
   --------
James has a sequence of N numbers. There is also an integer X which is a random number from other sources.

He is allowed to perform a specific operation on this sequence X number of times.

Below is the operation:

Pick exactly one element from the sequence and multiply it with -1.
Your task is to find out the number of different sequences which can be formed by performing the above operation.

If the answer is large, print the result modulo.

109 +7.

Let us try to understand it with an example,

N = 3

X = 2

S = [1, 2, 3]

There are 2 ways in which this operation can be performed.







Way 1: Either -1 should be multiplied to the same element 2 times, OR
Way 2: -1. Should be multiplied to two different elements once each.
Way 1:

If we multiply -1, to each element 2 times. It will become +1 (-1 *-1).

We will get same sequence for each element:





Multiply -1, 2 times to S[1] : [1, 2, 3].
Multiply -1, 2 times to S[2] : [1, 2, 3].
Multiply -1, 2 times to S[3] : [1, 2, 3].
So, the unique sequence is just 1 which is [1, 2, 3].

Way 2:

If we multiply -1, to two different elements just 1 time each. We get:





Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[2] : [-1, -2, 3].
Multiply -1 to S[2] & S[3] : [1, -2, -3].
Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[3] : [-1, 2, -3].
Hence, we get a total of 3 different sequences from Way 2.

Total 1 + 3 = 4 different sequences.

Hence the answer is 4.000
