*Throw the C program we have to create,to edit or to read Something is the Process Of File Handling.
                                                                                                                                                                             ----------------
*We have to Perform some functions throw file handling like:  
i) read the file of the System.
ii)open and  To search The data in the file.
iii) write or 'append' means to Extend or add data in the file .if the file exist with the same name.
* For File Handling we use the datatype name 'File'.This is a predefined datatype.
File is not a normal data type this is the special datatype.
*wild Pointer : if we declare a Pointer.But it does not initalized with anything
   ---------------  So Pointer have by default a garbage value.And If  Those garbage value is the address
of any File or data.So,this will give the damage of those particular file or data which we does not intialized.
*NULL :It is a Predefined value which is specificale used in while pointer.Because Empty is not Possible  
   -------   in computer.
*                                           FILE *fp=NULL;
This Command is named as NULL pointer.
*'fopen()' : It is the function which is used to Open the file.If we have to pass the file name .you should declared a 
double inverted Commas.
                                               fopen("filename.txt","mode");
*mode will be a stage in which we have the options to (either read,write and Append)
                                               fclose(fp);
*This will used as the last command of our program to close the file we haved opened.
This will be helpfull for Security and memory. 
                                               fflush(fp);
*This will use to refersh our system or the unsaved memory  is used to save if this will at the term of file.
                                               fgetc(fp);
*file get character: This will be use to read the file.
                                               fputc(fp);
*file put character: This will be used to write or append the file.
