NOTES:
*In Array,the indexing of an array will always start from zero and goes on to size-1.
*In Array, the memory allocation is done at Contigious order.
*If our given size of array is different to our initelize operation type then as a Developer we are responsible 
for size of array and operation among this could not impact to the machine.

#why we need an array?
   ----------------------------
If we talk about multiple data and the categories of data is same just like datatype.
we try to work on multiple data simultaniously, than we use to prefer an Array.

#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
int a[10],i;
printf("Enter 10 values in Array : \n");
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
printf("Enter values at %d position",(i+1));
scanf("%d",&a[i]);
}
printf("You have Entered:\n");
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
printf("%d\t",a[i]);
}
}
