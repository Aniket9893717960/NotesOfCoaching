#static keyword
  -------------------

static keyword can be used with variable declaration ,methord declaration and we also have static block as well.
if variable is declared as static than it will be treated as an class vaiable rether than instance vaiable.
it means that it's memory allocation will be dependent on loading of the class rether than creation of object
it also means that there will exeist only a single copy of static vaiables of all the objects and
all the objects will share the commenly allocated memory.objects are not allow to allocate seperate memory for static variables.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
static variables are accessable without any object directly throw it's class name
static methord is also independent from the object and we can access it without any object directly throw it's class name
                              it is a compelsion that a static methord that have either local variables or static variables in it's dafination.
static block is semilar to the static methord but it has more priority than the main methord.
