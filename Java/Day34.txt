#Inheritance
 ----------------

it is a property by which a class can aquare a properties of another class.
There are 5 types of inheritance.

i)Single level inheritance
 -----------------------------
 if there is a single parent or single child class on a program that there will be single level inheritance.

ii)Multi level inheritance
  ----------------------------
if a child class act like a parent class for another class then it will be multilevel inheritance.

iii)Hieraechical inheritance
   ------------------------------
A class having more than one child classes.

iv)Multiple inheritance
   --------------------------
*if we use this property in class than Ambiguty Error generate So,we use this in form of interfaces.
A class having more than one Parent classes.

v)Hybrid inheritance(This is also in c++ but it's a situation/scenario in which we call this Dimand Problem )
  ------------------------
This is a combination of multiple inheritance or a hieraechical inheritance.

class A
{
void show()
{
System.out.println("Hello from class A");
}

class B extends A
{
void display()
{
System.out.println("Hello from class B");
}
}

class Test
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
A a1 = new A();
B  b1 = new B();
a1.show();
b1.show();
b1.display();
}
}
