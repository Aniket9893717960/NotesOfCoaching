#  What are the advance feature of  JAVA which is not in C ,C++ ?
                                            OR
# Features of JAVA 
       
Java is an Object Oriented Language.
the feature of java are as follows:
1) platform Indepandance

Because of the bytecode functionality java is a platform independent
I)Platform nutral
Ii)Architectural Nutral

Memory allocaion of variable in java Indepentent of system architecture it means that all the variables 
will allways allocte a constant amount of memory on all the architecture(16 byte,32 byte ,24 byte) 

2) Simple and secure

java is a simple language for an experiance programer
*) Why java is a secure language?
java is secure because ,
a) java does not support pointer variable.
B) it has byte code securaty.
c) it has high encryption standard.

3)Rhobast

# Properties of Object Orientation in java

1) Class
class is a user defined datatype ,it is a collection of variables and methord.

2)Object
object is a real time(run time) entity.
it is an instance of a class that has a authority to access any content of a class.

3)Abstration/encapsulation
showing only essential features without showing any backgroung detail.
wrapping of data into a single unit is data encapsulation.

4) Inheritance
it is a feature by which a class can acquire(access) a content of another class.

5)Polymorphism
"Poly" means many

6)Dynamic Binding   //dynamic memory allocation and runtime memory allocation
7) Message Passing  //call by value and reaturn by value

#  first Program
class First
{
}
